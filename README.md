# Site Reliability Engineering Cheat Sheet

**Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies 
them to infrastructure and operations problems. The main goals are to create **scalable** and **highly reliable** 
software systems. According to Ben Treynor, founder of Google's Site Reliability Team, 
SRE is "what happens when a software engineer is tasked with what used to be called operations."

## Foundations

### 1. Embracing Risk (SLOs, Error Budgets, Monitoring, Alerting)

- Service failures can have many potential effects, including user dissatisfaction, harm, or loss of trust; 
direct or indirect revenue loss; brand or reputational impact; and undesirable press coverage.
- Unreliable systems can quickly erode users' confidence, so we want to reduce the chance of system failure.
- Cost does not increase linearly as reliability increments 
  (an incremental improvement in reliability may cost 100x more than the previous increment).
- It's **important to identify the appropriate level of reliability** by performing cost/benefit analysis to determine
  where on the **(nonlinear) risk continuum** a product should be placed.
- User experience is dominated by less reliable systems. Ex. mobile network is 99% reliable.

A few issues to consider when determining target level of availability:

- What level of service will the users expect?
- Does this service tie directly to revenue (either our revenue, or our customers' revenue)?
- Is this a paid service, or is it free?
- If there are competitors in the marketplace, what level of service do those competitors provide?
- Is this service targeted at consumers, or at enterprises?

#### SLIs, SLOs, SLAs 

- **SLI (Service Level Indicator)** - a carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of 
service that is provided. Examples: request latency, error rate, system throughput.
- **SLO (Service Level Objective)** a target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI. 
A natural structure for SLOs is thus **SLI ≤ target**, or **lower bound ≤ SLI ≤ upper bound**. 
SLOs are the tool by which you measure your service's reliability.
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** - an explicit or implicit contract with your users that includes consequences 
of meeting (or missing) the SLOs they contain. The consequences are most easily recognized when they are 
financial — a rebate or a penalty — but they can take other forms.

It's recommended to choose SLIs that can be represented as the ratio of two numbers: 
**the number of good events divided by the total number of events**. 
SLIs of this form have a couple of particularly useful properties:
- The SLI ranges from 0% to 100%, where 0% means nothing works, and 100% means nothing is broken.
- This style lends itself easily to the concept of an error budget: the SLO is a target percentage and the error 
budget is 100% minus the SLO.
- Making all of your SLIs follow a consistent style allows you to take better advantage of tooling: you can write 
alerting logic, SLO analysis tools, error budget calculation, and reports to expect the same inputs: 
numerator, denominator, and threshold. Simplification is a bonus here.

There are two types of SLOs:
- **Request-based SLOs** - based on an SLI that is defined as the ratio of the number of good requests to 
the total number of requests. 
    - **"Latency is below 100 ms for at least 95% of requests."** A good request is one with a response time less 
    than 100 ms, so the measure of compliance is the fraction of requests with response times under 100 ms. 
- **Windows-based SLOs** - based on an SLI defined as the ratio of the number of measurement intervals that meets 
some goodness criterion to the total number of intervals.
    - **"The 95th percentile latency metric is less than 100 ms for at least 99% of 10-minute windows"**. 
    A good measurement period is a 10-minute span in which 95% of the requests have latency under 100 ms.
    
There are two types of compliance periods for SLOs:
- **Calendar-based** periods (from date to date).
- **Rolling periods** (from n days ago to now, where n ranges from 1 to 30 days).

#### Error Budgets

**Error budgets** are a tool for balancing reliability with other engineering work, and a great way to decide 
which projects will have the most impact. 
Changes are a major source of instability, representing roughly 70% of our outages, and development work for features 
competes with development work for stability. 
The error budget forms a control mechanism for diverting attention to stability as needed.

An error budget is 1 minus the SLO of the service. A 99.9% SLO service has a 0.1% error budget.
If our service receives 1,000,000 requests in four weeks, a 99.9% availability SLO gives us 
a budget of 1,000 errors over that period.

### [Example Error Budget Policy](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/error-budget-policy/):

**Goals**:
- Protect customers from repeated SLO misses
- Provide an incentive to balance reliability with other features

**SLO Miss Policy**:
- If the service is performing at or above its SLO, then releases (including data changes) will proceed according to the release policy.
- If the service has exceeded its error budget for the preceding four-week window, we will halt all changes and releases other than P01 issues or security fixes until the service is back within its SLO.
- Depending upon the cause of the SLO miss, the team may devote additional resources to working on reliability instead of feature work.
- The team must work on reliability if:
    - A code bug or procedural error caused the service itself to exceed the error budget.
    - A postmortem reveals an opportunity to soften a hard dependency.
    - Miscategorized errors fail to consume budget that would have caused the service to miss its SLO.
- The team may continue to work on non-reliability features if:
    - The outage was caused by a company-wide networking problem.
    - The outage was caused by a service maintained by another team, who have themselves frozen releases to address their reliability issues.
    - The error budget was consumed by users out of scope for the SLO (e.g., load tests or penetration testers).
    - Miscategorized errors consume budget even though no users were impacted.
    
**Outage Policy**:
- If a single incident consumes more than 20% of error budget over four weeks, then the team must conduct a postmortem. 
  The postmortem must contain at least one P0 action item to address the root cause.
- If a single class of outage consumes more than 20% of error budget over a quarter, the team must have a P0 item on 
  their quarterly planning document2 to address the issues in the following quarter.

**Escalation Policy**:
- In the event of a disagreement between parties regarding the calculation of the error budget or the specific 
  actions it defines, the issue should be escalated to the CTO to make a decision.
  
- Don't over-rely on 3rd party services. Chubby had too good of SLIs and users over-relied on it. 
  They had to make planned service outages to prevent it.

#### Alerting on SLOs**:

https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/alerting-on-slos/

Your goal is to be notified for a significant event: **an event that consumes a large fraction of the error budget**.

Consider the following attributes when evaluating an alerting strategy:
- **Precision** - the proportion of events detected that were significant. The fewer false positives the higher the precision.
- **Recall** - the proportion of significant events detected. The fewer false negatives the higher the recall.
- **Detection time** - how long it takes to send notifications in various conditions. 
  Long detection times can negatively impact the error budget.
- **Reset time** - how long alerts fire after an issue is resolved. 
  Long reset times can lead to confusion or to issues being ignored.
  
**Burn rate** is how fast, relative to the SLO, the service consumes the error budget. 
- Burn rate of 1 means that it's consuming error budget at a rate that leaves you with exactly 0 budget at the end 
  of the SLO's time window.
- With 100% downtime the burn rate is `1 / ((100% - SLO) * 100)`.

| Burn rate | Error rate for a 99.9% SLO | Time to exhaustion |
| --- | --- | ---  |
| 1 | 0.1% | 30 days |
| 2 | 0.2% | 15 days |
| 10 | 1% | 3 days |
| 1000 | 100% | 43 minutes |
  
Ways to alert on significant events:

- 1: Target Error Rate ≥ SLO Threshold. For example, if the SLO is 99.9% over 30 days, alert if the error rate over the previous 10 minutes is ≥ 0.1%:
    - `expr: job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate10m{job="myjob"} >= 0.001`.
    - Cons: Precision is low: The alert fires on many events that do not threaten the SLO. 
      A 0.1% error rate for 10 minutes would alert, while consuming only 0.02% of the monthly error budget.
- 2: Increased Alert Window. To keep the rate of alerts manageable, you decide to be notified only if an event 
consumes 5% of the 30-day error budget — a 36-hour window.
    - `expr: job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate36h{job="myjob"} > 0.001`.
    - Cons:
        - Very poor reset time: In the case of 100% outage, an alert will fire shortly after 2 minutes, 
          and continue to fire for the next 36 hours.
        - Calculating rates over longer windows can be expensive in terms of memory or I/O operations, 
          due to the large number of data points.
- 3: Incrementing Alert Duration. Most monitoring systems allow you to add a duration parameter to the alert criteria 
so the alert won't fire unless the value remains above the threshold for some time.
    - `expr: job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate1m{job="myjob"} > 0.001; for: 1h'`.
    - Cons:
        - Poor recall and poor detection time: Because the duration does not scale with the severity of the incident, 
          a 100% outage alerts after one hour, the same detection time as a 0.2% outage.
        - If the metric even momentarily returns to a level within SLO, the duration timer resets. 
          An SLI that fluctuates between missing SLO and passing SLO may never alert.
- 4: Alert on Burn Rate. 
    - `job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate1h{job="myjob"} > (36*0.001)` 
    - Cons:
        - Low recall: A 35x burn rate never alerts, but consumes all of the 30-day error budget in 20.5 hours.
        - Reset time: 58 minutes is still too long.
- 5: Multiple Burn Rate Alerts.
    - ```
        expr: (
            job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate1h{job="myjob"} > (14.4*0.001)
            or
            job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate6h{job="myjob"} > (6*0.001)
        )
        severity: page
        
        expr: job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate3d{job="myjob"} > 0.001
        severity: ticket
      ```
    - Cons:
        - More numbers, window sizes, and thresholds to manage and reason about.
        - An even longer reset time, as a result of the three-day window.
        - To avoid multiple alerts from firing if all conditions are true, you need to implement alert suppression.
- 6: Multiwindow, Multi-Burn-Rate Alerts. https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/alerting-on-slos/#recommended_parameters_for_an_slo_based_a
    - ```
        expr: (
            job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate1h{job="myjob"} > (14.4*0.001)
            and
            job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate5m{job="myjob"} > (14.4*0.001)
        )
        or
        (
            job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate6h{job="myjob"} > (6*0.001)
            and
            job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate30m{job="myjob"} > (6*0.001)
        )
        severity: page
        
        (
            job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate3d{job="myjob"} > 0.001
            and
            job:slo_errors_per_request:ratio_rate6h{job="myjob"} > 0.001
        )
        severity: ticket
      ``` 
    - Cons:
        - Lots of parameters to specify, which can make alerting rules hard to manage.   

**Fast-burn / slow-burn** strategy described here https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/service-monitoring/alerting-on-budget-burn-rate#burn-rates
corresponds to strategy 5 or 6 above.
  

**Notes**:
- GCP's Monitoring service allows alerting on burn rate: 
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/service-monitoring/alerting-on-budget-burn-rate,
https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/service-monitoring#slo-types.
- Creating SLOs in Anthos: https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/observability/create-slo.
- Extreme availability SLOs. With target monthly availability of 99.999% a 100% outage would exhaust its budget
in 26 seconds - not enough to react. The only way to defend this level of reliability is to design the system so that
the chance of a 100% outage is extremely low. For example if you roll out a change to 1% of the machines you will have 
43 minutes before you exhaust your error budget. 
- [Availability Table](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/availability-table/#appendix_table-of-nines).


#### Monitoring

The 4 golden signals: 
- **Latency**. The time it takes to service a request. 
- **Traffic**. A measure of how much demand is being placed on your system, 
measured in a high-level system-specific metric. E.g. HTTP requests per second, network I/O rate, concurrent sessions.
- **Errors**. The rate of requests that fail, either explicitly (e.g., HTTP 500s), 
implicitly (for example, an HTTP 200 success response, but coupled with the wrong content), 
or by policy (for example, "If you committed to one-second response times, any request over one second is an error").
- **Saturation**. How "full" your service is. A measure of your system fraction, emphasizing the resources that are 
most constrained (e.g., in a memory-constrained system, show memory; in an I/O-constrained system, show I/O). 
Note that many systems degrade in performance before they achieve 100% utilization, so having a utilization target 
is essential.

**Monitoring symptoms vs causes**:
- Symptoms are metrics that are visible to users of the service or application. For example low latency, many errors. 
- Causes are metrics that are not visible to users. For example high CPU usage on the web server, 
high rate of refused connections in the database.  

**Best practices**:
- **Monitor the versions of the components**. Monitor the command-line flags, especially when you use these flags to 
enable and disable **features** of the service. If configuration data is pushed to your service dynamically, 
**monitor the version of this dynamic configuration**. When you're trying to correlate an outage with a rollout, 
it's much easier to look at a graph/dashboard linked from your alert than to trawl through your CI/CD 
system logs after the fact.
- Even if your service didn't change, any of its dependencies might change or have problems, 
so you should also monitor responses coming from direct dependencies.
- Monitor saturation: 
    - resources with hard limits: RAM, disk, or CPU quota; 
    - resources without hard limits: open file descriptors, active threads in any thread pools, waiting times in queues, 
      or the volume of written logs.
    - programming language specific metrics: the heap and metaspace size for Java, the number of goroutines for Go.  
- Test alerting logic: https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/monitoring/#testing-alerting-logic.

### 2. Eliminating Toil

**Toil** - repetitive, predictable, constant stream of tasks related to maintaining a service.

**Characteristics of toil**:

- **Manual**. This includes work such as manually running a script that automates some task.
- **Repetitive**. If you're performing a task for the first time ever, or even the second time, this work is not toil. 
  Toil is work you do over and over. If you're solving a novel problem or inventing a new solution, this work is not toil.
- **Automatable**. If a machine could accomplish the task just as well as a human, or the need for the task could be 
  designed away, that task is toil. If human judgment is essential for the task, there's a good chance it's not toil.
- **Tactical**. Toil is interrupt-driven and reactive, rather than strategy-driven and proactive. 
  Handling pager alerts is toil. We may never be able to eliminate this type of work completely, 
  but we have to continually work toward minimizing it. 
- **No enduring value**. If your service remains in the same state after you have finished a task, the task was 
  probably toil. If the task produced a permanent improvement in your service, it probably wasn't toil, 
  even if some amount of grunt work—such as digging into legacy code and configurations and straightening 
  them out—was involved.
- **O(n) with service growth**. If the work involved in a task scales up linearly with service size, traffic volume, 
  or user count, that task is probably toil. An ideally managed and designed service can grow by at least one order of 
  magnitude with zero additional work, other than some one-time efforts to add resources.

Things like answering emails, expense reports, meetings, travelling is not considered toil, it's considered overhead.
  
The goal is to keep toil below **50%** of each SRE. Toil tends to expand if left unchecked and can quickly fill 
100% of everyone's time. The work of reducing toil and scaling up services is the **"Engineering"** in 
Site Reliability Engineering. Engineering work is what enables the SRE organization to scale up sublinearly 
with service size and to manage services more efficiently than either a pure Dev team or a pure Ops team.

**Measuring toil**:

- Don't mix toil and project work. Concentrate toil during your on-call week.
- Have people track their toil time.
- Survey, sample and log toil (e.g monthly). 
- Streamline the measurement process using tools or scripts so that collecting these measurements doesn't 
  create additional toil! 
  
**Toil taxonomy**:

- **Business Processes**
- **Production Interrupts**. For example, you may need to fix an acute shortage of some resource (disk, memory, I/O) 
  by manually freeing up disk space or restarting applications that are leaking memory. 
- **Release Shepherding**. In many organizations, deployment tools automatically shepherd releases from development to production. 
Depending on the tooling and release cadence, release requests, rollbacks, emergency patches, and repetitive or 
manual configuration changes, releases may still generate toil.
- **Migrations**. 
- **Cost Engineering and Capacity Planning**
- **Troubleshooting for Opaque Architectures**. Troubleshooting may require logging in to individual systems and 
  writing ad hoc log analytics queries with scripting tools.

**Toil Management Strategies**:

- **Identify and Measure Toil**. See above.
- **Engineer Toil Out of the System**. Before investing effort in managing the toil generated by your existing systems and 
  processes, examine whether you can reduce or eliminate that toil by changing the system.
- **Reject the Toil**. For a given set of toil, analyze the cost of responding to the toil versus not doing so. Another tactic is to intentionally delay the toil so that tasks accumulate for batch or parallelized processing.
- **Use SLOs to Reduce Toil**. A well-defined SLO enables engineers to make informed decisions. 
For example, you might ignore certain operational tasks if doing so does not consume or exceed the service's error budget.
- **Start with Human-Backed Interfaces**. Consider a partially automated approach as an interim step toward full 
  automation. In this approach, your service receives structured data—usually via a defined API—but engineers may still 
  handle some of the resulting operations.
- **Provide Self-Service Methods**. You can provide a web form, binary or script, API, or even just documentation 
that tells users how to issue pull requests to your service's configuration files.
- **Get Support from Management and Colleagues**. It is important for everyone in the organization to agree that 
  toil reduction is a worthwhile goal.
- **Promote Toil Reduction as a Feature**. If a complementary goal—for example, security, scalability, or 
  reliability—is compelling to your customers, they'll be more willing to give up their current toil-generating 
  systems for shiny new ones that aren't as toil intentive. Then, reducing toil is just a nice side effect of 
  helping users!
- **Start Small and Then Improve**. Automate a few high-priority items first, and then improve your solution using 
  the time you gained by eliminating that toil
- **Increase Uniformity**. At scale, a diverse production environment becomes exponentially harder to manage.
  Teams are free to choose their own approaches, but they have to own the toil generated by unsupported tools or legacy systems.
- **Assess Risk Within Automation**. Automation can save countless hours in human labor, but in the wrong circumstances, 
  it can also trigger outages. Handle user input defensively. Minimize the impact of outages caused by incomplete 
  safety checks of automation. Automation should default to human operators if it runs into an unsafe condition. 
- **Automate Toil Response**. Once your process is thoroughly documented, try to break down the manual work into 
  components that can be implemented separately and used to create a composable software library that other 
  automation projects can reuse later.
- **Use Open Source and Third-Party Tools**.
- **Use Feedback to Improve**.


### 3. Simplicity

**Complexity** can be:

- **Intrinsic** - the complexity inherent in a given situation that cannot be removed from a problem definition. 
- **Accidental** - more fluid and can be resolved with engineering effort.
    
For example, writing a web server entails dealing with the essential complexity of serving web pages quickly. However, if we write a web server in Java, we may introduce accidental complexity when trying to minimize the performance impact of garbage collection.    
  
- Push back when accidental complexity is introduced into the systems for which they are responsible.
- Constantly strive to eliminate complexity in systems they onboard and for which they assume operational responsibility.

**I Won’t Give Up My Code!**

- SRE promotes practices that make it more likely that all code has an essential purpose, such as **scrutinizing code** 
to make sure that it actually **drives business goals**, routinely **removing dead code**, 
and building **bloat detection** into all levels of testing. 
    
**The "Negative Lines of Code" Metric**

"The less code, the better! 1 point for adding a line of code, but 2 points for deleting a line. Bloatware is the devil."
- Elon Musk, https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1211557592125857793?lang=en.

*Muntzing* is the practice and technique of reducing the components inside an electronic appliance to the minimum 
required for it to function. The term is named after the man who invented it, Earl "Madman" Muntz, a car and 
electronics salesman who was also a self-taught electrical engineer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muntzing    

**Minimal APIs**

"Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no 
longer anything to take away" - Antoine de Saint Exupery.

The fewer methods and arguments we provide to consumers of the API, the easier that API will be to understand, 
and the more effort we can devote to making those methods as good as they can possibly be.
A small, simple API is usually also a hallmark of a well-understood problem.

**Modularity**

Many of the rules of thumb that apply to object-oriented programming also apply to the design of distributed systems.
A well-designed distributed system consists of collaborators, each of which has a clear and well-scoped purpose.
      
**Simplification is a feature**
 
Reserve 10% of engineering project time for "simplicity" projects.


## Practices

2. Managing Load.
3. Configuration Management.
4. Reliability Testing.

## Relation to DevOps

SRE is closely related to DevOps.

**DevOps** is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops) 
which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

Goals of DevOps:

- Improved deployment frequency;
- Faster time to market;
- Lower failure rate of new releases;
- Shortened lead time between fixes;
- Faster mean time to recovery;

DevOps is more holistically defined and has many goals including quality, reliability, faster time to market, etc., 
while SRE focuses primarily on reliability and everything else is implied. SRE is deeper in this sense and DevOps
is broader.

**Notes**:

- Reliability deals with behaviour of failure rate over a long period of operation, while quality control
deals with percent of defectives based on performance specifications at a certain point in time.
